		<h1>Soda kills people.. There have been reportedly 31,000 deaths from soda throughout the years 2017-2019. Many of these people died from to much bubbling going on in the stomach and then it ends up blowing up in their body. A student in harvard that weighed 800 pounds was reported dead because his stomach exploded from a lot of Mountain Dew the previous night. Many people were sprayed from the big explosion and were suffering from acid burns.
